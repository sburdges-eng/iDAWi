## Current Status Summary

**Last Updated**: December 2024

### Phase 0: Pre-Alpha (~60% Complete)

| Area | Completed | Pending | Status |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Core Architecture Design | 12 items | 0 items | ✅ Done |
| Core Algorithm Implementation | 0 items | 10 items | 🔴 Critical |
| Architecture Documentation | 0 items | 4 ADRs + specs | 🟡 Should Do |
| Build System Config | 11 items | 0 items | ✅ Done |
| Build Scripts | 3 items | 1 item | ✅ Done |
| Cross-compilation | 0 items | 5 targets | 🟡 Should Do |
| Project Structure | 7 items | 0 items | ✅ Done |
| Duplicate Cleanup | 2 areas | 1 area | ✅ Done |
| RT-Safety Infra | 0 items | 7 items | 🟡 Recommended |

### What's Working Now
- ✅ Python music intelligence layer (CLI, emotion analysis, groove extraction)
- ✅ C++ engine interfaces fully designed (headers complete)
- ✅ OSC communication layer designed
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with 5 GitHub Actions workflows
- ✅ Test infrastructure (pytest + GoogleTest)
- ✅ React + Tauri UI foundation scaffolded
- ✅ CrewAI agent framework for local LLM orchestration
- ✅ 11 art-themed plugins specified
- ✅ **NEW**: `build.sh` and `build.ps1` one-command build scripts
- ✅ **NEW**: `test.sh` unified test runner
- ✅ **NEW**: Duplicate C++ headers and Python packages removed

### 🟡 Remaining Blockers (Before Phase 1)
1. **All C++ implementations are stubs** - No actual algorithms (10 modules)
2. ~~**Duplicate files** - 3 copies of headers, nested packages~~ ✅ FIXED
3. ~~**No build scripts** - Manual CMake required~~ ✅ FIXED
4. **No RT-safety validation** - Can't verify audio thread safety (recommended)

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ~~Remove duplicate files and consolidate structure~~ ✅ DONE
2. ~~Create `build.sh` / `build.ps1` scripts~~ ✅ DONE
3. Implement `RTMessageQueue` (first real lock-free code)
4. Implement `ChordAnalyzer` and `TempoEstimator`
5. Set up RT-safety validation framework

### Future Phases Ready to Start After Phase 0
- Phase 1: Real-Time Audio Engine (C++ Core)
- Phase 2: Plugin Hosting System
- Phase 3: AI/ML Intelligence Layer
- Phase 4: Desktop Application
